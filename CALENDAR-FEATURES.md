## 🤖 **AI Suggestion Algorithm**

### **Importance Scoring Factors**
1. **Relationship Type** (Mentor: +20, VC: +15, Recruiter: +10)
2. **Contact Tags** (VC: +10, Mentor: +15, Startup: +5)
3. **Last Contact** (Never contacted: +10)
4. **Meeting Cadence** (Based on preferred frequency)

### **Timing Logic**
1. **Use nextFollowUp date** if set
2. **Calculate from meeting cadence** if specified
3. **Default to 2 weeks** from last contact
4. **Fallback to 2 weeks** from now

### **Message Generation**
AI generates contextual follow-up messages like:
- "Check in with [Name] about their latest projects"
- "Follow up on our previous conversation with [Name]"
- "Touch base with [Name] to maintain the relationship"
